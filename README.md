- Detailed Bio:
       At present I'm working as Associate HR Consultant for the past one year. But, I'm interested in Coding. So, I decided to move into development. 
  I searched in internet to choose the best field of development which has a high scope and demand and which is also more creative and make us push to
  our limits of coding. Finally, I found that Full Stack Development is a good one to go with and decided to learn it. As of now I have some mini tasks 
  done to display my work. And I also have a personal portfolio to see my profile and contact me easily.
